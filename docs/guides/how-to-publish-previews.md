# How to publish previews

When working on this components library, we often need to publish and share a live preview of the components to get some feedbacks.
In order to do this, we have a series of scripts to quickly publish a preview.

_**WARNINGS:**_ All the following commands require a private config file to access the Cellar `addon_9feadcac-4278-4af1-bfea-597477bf9b92`.
It must be named `.clever-components-previews.s3cfg` and placed at the root of the project.

## List previews

You can list the currently published previews with:

```
npm run preview:list
```

You can also browse this page:

https://clever-components-preview.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/index.html

## Publish/update a preview

When you're working on a branch, and you want to publish a preview, you'll need to build the static Storybook first:

```
npm run storybook:build
```

Once the build is ready, you can publish a preview with:

```
npm run preview:sync
```

* By the default, the preview will be named like your current branch.
* If there's already a published preview with this name, it will be replaced.

You can publish a preview with a different name with:

```
npm run preview:sync feature-x-blue
```

This is often required when you work on a branch but you want to share multiple iterations/ideas of a given feature.

## Delete a preview

When you're done with a preview, you can delete it with:

```
npm run preview:delete preview-name
```

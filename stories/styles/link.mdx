# Link styles

We want all the HTML links included in our components to look the same and have the same behaviour.
Instead of creating a link component, we're simply sharing some styles that any component can import and reuse.

## Features

* Default style with 5.2 color contrast ratio.
* Hover style with pointer cursor (default) and slightly darker color.
* Focus styles with focus ring (and white background).
* Works well with `.skeleton`.

## How to use it?

In your component, import the styles like this:

```js
import { linkStyles } from 'components/styles/link.js';
```

Then you need to use it in your LitElement `static get styles()` like this:

```js
static get styles () {
  return [
    linkStyles,
    css`
      /* CSS for component goes here */
    `  
  ]
}
```

With this setup, you'll be able to use the `.cc-link` CSS class on the links of your components like this:

```html
<a class="cc-link" href="https://example.com">This is a link using the link styles</a>
```
